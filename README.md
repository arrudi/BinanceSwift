# BinanceSwift

This is my first attempt to create something in Swift

1) It's my first package
2) It's my first implementation of an API for Binance
3) It's one of my first programs in Swift
4) It's my first github repo

So please, be kind to me... and help me making this library better. There's a lot still to do
